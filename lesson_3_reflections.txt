1) When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

When you want to share your finished work.
When you are collaborating with others on the same project.
As a way to back up your work in case the local directory is damaged.

2) Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

If you share work on GitHub with other colleagues, you might not want to pull down automatically every single change your colleauges
are making.

3) What are some situations when branches would be helpful in keeping your history organized? How would branches help?
   - separate languages
   - master mode
   - test modes
   - different teams

4) How do the diagrams help you visualize the branch structure?

You can see when you branch off in a different direction and which commits were made on the new branch.   

5) What is the result of merging two branches together? Why do we represent it in the diagram the way we do?

You combine the commits of both branches, arranged according to date.  You remove the coins label, as master
contains both sets of commits.

6) What are the pros and cons of Gitâ€™s automatic merging vs. always doing merges manually?

It makes things easier and faster.
